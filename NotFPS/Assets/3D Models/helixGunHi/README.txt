INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING bioMECHANIX MODELS for MAC or PC

Wether you ordered the CD or unzipped a copy from the net, you should put the folders that you end up with in your Geometries directory.  If you not sure where this folder is then locate the directory where poser is, then open Runtime.  You should see the Geometries folder there.

Open up poser first.  From the file menu choose open and open any of the .pz3 files that are contained in the folders you've placed under the Geometries directory.

If you have any problems email Keith Hunter at hunter@rhythm.com, or call 323-295-8925
